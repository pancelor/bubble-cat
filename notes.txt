ideas
* rm sfx
* rm score ticker
x get seed code
x check lag
x float linear
x px => px*9
x \d\s(and|or)
x unpack better
x b|16
x d=q and"-6"
x ==0 <1 many?
x ... in fa
* b*.5938&.75 shorter?
x memset +_sfx()
x bn array
x pre px*9
* bn hash
* only 0..9 spawns (1 char)
* change draw position (s/+1//)

goal:
* 605 (method: run compress, copy into twitter, delete final newline, add 280, add uncompressed count)
